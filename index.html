        <h3>Backstage Secretary: 2024 - 2025</h3>
        <p>
            In the 2024-2025 academic year I took up the role of Secretary
             on the <a href="https://www.bts-crew.com">Backstage Technical Services</a> committee.
            My primary focus in taking the role was to modernise the way the society was viewed,
             as well as to advertise the society more widely in order to increase membership numbers 
             and diversity the skillset and interests among the society membership. <br>
            One key focus was in upgrading the society's stationary and branding, extending to our logos, 
            documentation, website, and business cards. I developed simple elegant branding guidelines including 
            a clean colour scheme and modernised logo images.
            Another key focus of my tenure as Secretary was to focus on ways I could help facilitate other committee 
            members, such that they can more easily achieve progress while also balancing their degrees. <br>
