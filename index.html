        <p>
            I am currently in the third year of a mathematics degree at the University of Bath, currently at an approximately 80% average and on track for a 1:1.<br>
            Here my focus is primarily directed towards topics in Algebra and Number Theory. <br>
            In particular modules such as Group theory (82%), Number theory (83%), Measure theory (75%), Vector calculus and PDEs (87%), Algebra 2A [Advanced Linear Algebra] (80%), and Algebra 2B [Groups, Rings, and Fields] (82%). <br>

        <h3>Backstage Secretary: 2024 - 2025</h3>
        <p>
            In the 2024-2025 academic year I took up the role of Secretary
             on the <a href="https://www.bts-crew.com">Backstage Technical Services</a> committee.
            My primary focus in taking the role was to modernise the way the society was viewed,
             as well as to advertise the society more widely in order to increase membership numbers 
             and diversity the skillset and interests among the society membership. <br>
            One key focus was in upgrading the society's stationary and branding, extending to our logos, 
            documentation, website, and business cards. I developed simple elegant branding guidelines including 
            a clean colour scheme and modernised logo images.
            Another key focus of my tenure as Secretary was to focus on ways I could help facilitate other committee 
            members, such that they can more easily achieve progress while also balancing their degrees. <br>

        <h3>Freshers' Week 2023 [Head of Sound]</h3>
        <p>
            For FW23 in September 2023, I was tasked with designing and deploying a PA system suitable for an audience of approx. 3000 punters in the University of Bath Founders' Hall for the period of one week. 
            The focus of the design was a D&B Q-Series line-array system comprised of 6 boxes of Q1 either side of the stage, E6 front-fill, and J-Series subwoofers, driven by a stack of D80 & D20 amplifiers. This equipment was provided by Amber Audio. 
            Design for the project began in Summer 2024, with the rig taking place over the course of 2 days and get-out taking place in an overnight push, followed by a short clean up period the following day.
