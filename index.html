        <h2>Academic Study</h2>
        <p>
            I am currently in the fourth year of a mathematics degree at the University of Bath, currently at an approximately 80% average and on track for a first.<br>
            I am interested in studying topics related to algebra, particularly representation theory in positive characteristic. <br>

        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>

        <h3>LMS Project - Simple Lie algebras in positive characteristic: Summer 2025</h3>
        <p>
            I recieved funding from the <i>London Mathematical Society Undergraduate Reserach Bursary</i> to study the Jacobson Witt algebras with Dr Lewis Topley.
            Our aim was to study the centre of the Universal Enveloping Algebra of the Jacobson Witt algebras, with an end goal of being able to describe the entire centre.
            As part of the project, I developed a program using the computer algebra package <i>SAGE</i> with <i>Python</i> to work with elements of the Jacobson Witt algebras and elements in the UEA.
            I am continuing this project for my Masters' Thesis.

            In the 2024-2025 academic year I took up the role of Secretary, and for 2025-2026 Chair,
             on the <a href="https://www.bts-crew.com">Backstage Technical Services</a> committee.
