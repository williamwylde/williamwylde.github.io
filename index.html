        <h2>Academic Study</h2>
        <p>
            I am in the fourth year of a mathematics degree at the University of Bath on track for a first.<br>
            I am interested in studying topics related to algebra, particularly representation theory in positive characteristic. <br>

        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>

        <h3>LMS Project - Simple Lie algebras in positive characteristic: Summer 2025</h3>
        <p>
            I was awarded the <i>London Mathematical Society Undergraduate Reserach Bursary</i> to study the Jacobson Witt algebras with Dr Lewis Topley.
            Our aim was to study the central elements, with an end goal of being able to describe generators of the centre of the Universal Enveloping Algebra of a Jacobson Witt algebra
            in arbitrary rank and characteristic.<br>
            As part of the project, I developed a program using the computer algebra package <i>SAGE</i> with <i>Python</i> to work with elements of the Jacobson Witt algebras and elements in the UEA.<br>
            Reading for this project included sections from <i>Modular Lie Algebras and their Representations</i> by Strade & Farnsteiner.

        <h3>Backstage Committee: 2024 - 2026</h3>
        <p>
            In the 2024-2025 academic year I took up the role of Secretary, and for 2025-2026 Chair,
            on the <a href="https://www.bts-crew.com">Backstage Technical Services</a> committee. As a committee member, I was responsible for the day-to-day running of the society
            and as Chair I was also responsible for the society's relationships within the University of Bath, as well as society finances.
